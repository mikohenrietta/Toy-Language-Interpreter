# 🚀 Toy Language Interpreter

## 📌 Overview


This project is a simple interpreter for a toy programming language. The interpreter processes source code written in the toy language, parses it, and executes the corresponding operations. The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight and educational implementation of an interpreter, demonstrating fundamental concepts of language design, parsing, and execution.

## ✨ Features

⚡ Interpreter: Evaluates the statement and executes operations accordingly.

🔢 Basic Data Types: Supports integers, strings, booleans and reference values.

🔄 Control Flow: Implements if statements and loops.

❌ Error Handling: Provides basic error reporting for syntax and runtime issues.

## 🖥️ Program Execution

When the application opens, you can choose to run one of several pre-written programs. These programs may include:

- while loops

- if statements

- Process forking

- Reading from and writing to text files

Once a program is selected, a new window opens where you can:

- View the heap, symbol table, output, and text file table

- Observe different programs if multiple processes were created using fork

- Execute the program step by step, tracking changes in real-time
